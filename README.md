# Genetic-Algorithms-for-Vertex-Cover
This is a term project for the course Genetic Algorithms in Engineering Process Modelling under Prof Nirupam Chakrabarti.
I have presented a technique that uses Genetic Algorithms to solve the Vertex Cover Problem, and compared the results with the results obtained from solving the problem with popular heuristics.
